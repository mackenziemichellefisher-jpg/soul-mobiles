# üåå soulr.space ‚Äî A Distributed Memex of Human Emotion

**soulr.space** is a mobile-first web experience activated by NFC-enabled orbs placed in the physical world. When you tap an orb, you're invited to anonymously respond to a daily prompt and receive a random message ‚Äî a "gift" ‚Äî left by someone else who stood in that same spot.

It's a serendipity engine.  
A soft social network.  
A memex of human memory, distributed across space and time.

## üß† Core Concept

soulr.space orbs are like physical portals. Each is tied to a real-world location and accessed via NFC. When tapped, users are offered:

- A **daily rotating prompt**
- A **random gift** left by another visitor
- The chance to **leave their own anonymous gift**

Each gift becomes part of a growing, decentralized archive of thoughts, feelings, and artifacts ‚Äî a kind of digital time capsule shaped by place and chance.

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
